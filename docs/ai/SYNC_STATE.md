# AI Agent Synchronization State

## Current Session Status
- **Agent Name**: Antigravity
- **Last Updated**: 2026-07-16T07:18:00Z
- **Current Version**: 1.5.17 (build 26.2.45.57)
- **Status**: Stable / Released

## Recent Accomplishments
1. **DWM Title Bar Cohesion (Windows 11)**:
   - Integrated TitleBarDwm using dwmapi.dll (DWMWA_CAPTION_COLOR, DWMWA_TEXT_COLOR, DWMWA_BORDER_COLOR) to seamlessly blend the native OS title bar with the application's internal dark/light theme on Windows 11 (Build >= 22000).
   - Preserved FormBorderStyle.Sizable, maintaining 100% of native Windows features like Snap Layouts, multi-monitor DPI scaling, and drop shadows.
   - Handled graceful fallback to default OS title bar for Windows 10 without throwing exceptions.
2. **Handle Recreation Hotfix (v1.5.17)**:
   - Fixed an issue where the C# Form.OnHandleCreated method could not be overridden properly due to internal visibility modifier constraints.
   - Switched to subscribing to the HandleCreated event inside the form constructors (LauncherForm and ServerSetupForm).
   - Ensures DWM color states are preserved even when the window handle is forcefully recreated by the WinForms engine (e.g. ShowInTaskbar updates).
3. **Release v1.5.17**:
   - Bumped version to 1.5.17.
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md with multi-language hotfix notes.
   - Successfully ran Publish-LocalRelease.ps1 and pushed the new artifacts to GitHub Releases.

## Active Issues / Next Steps
- **Monitoring**: Everything is currently stable. Monitor for any reports of unhandled exceptions from dwmapi.dll calls on unusual Windows versions.

## Workspace Context
- **Encoding Rule**: All PowerShell .ps1, C# .cs, and .md files must be saved with **UTF-8 with BOM** to avoid build failures with the local csc.exe and signtool.
- **Certificates**: Local signing throws warnings in PS but still signs successfully.
